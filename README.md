# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
This is a simple interest calculator that calculates the simple interest based on the provided principal amount, time period in years, and annual rate of interest.

## Input
- `p`: Principal amount
- `t`: Time period in years
- `r`: Annual rate of interest

## Output
- `Simple Interest`: Calculated using the formula: `p * t * r`

## Usage
1. Provide the principal amount (`p`), time period in years (`t`), and annual rate of interest (`r`).
2. Run the calculator.
3. The calculated simple interest will be displayed as output.

## Formula
The simple interest (`SI`) is calculated using the formula:

## Example
- **Input**: `p = 1000`, `t = 2`, `r = 5`
- **Output**: `Simple Interest = 1000 * 2 * 5 = 100`
